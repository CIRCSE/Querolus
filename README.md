# Querolus

This repository contains the text of Querolus, an anonymous Latin comedy dating back to V century AD.
The text, belonging to a late stage of the Latin language, was taken from the Digital library of late-antique Latin texts (*digilibLT*). 

The text was first tokenised (14745 resulting tokens) and manually annotated with respect to lemmatisation, PoS tagging and morphological features. 
The annotation follows the Universal Dependencies (UD) schema.
Tokens were then linked to LEMLAT (*Passarotti et al., 2017*) through alphanumeric codes representing the identifiers of LEMLAT lexical entries.
The annotated text was eventually converted into the CoNLL-U and Turtle format.
